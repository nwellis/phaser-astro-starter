## Why Astro?

Astro is a lightweight but powerful build tool that can add a lot of features. You can easily mix and
match normal web pages with your game, or even write your game UI in HTML with ease. Not interested in
using Astro? Here's a more applicable starter that provides much of the tooling that Astro does
without those pesky opinions!

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/sprites
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ basictiles.png
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PhaserGame.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ PhaserGame.element.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ game/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _common/*
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ demo/*
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
